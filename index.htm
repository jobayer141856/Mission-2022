            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>A mission statement, or simply a mission, is a public declaration that schools or other educational organizations use to describe their founding purpose and major organizational commitments—i.e., what they do and why they do it. A mission statement may describe a school’s day-to-day operational objectives, its instructional values, or its public commitments to its students and community. </p>

            <h3>Vission</h3>
            <p>
                A vision statement, or simply a vision, is a public declaration that schools or other educational organizations use to describe their high-level goals for the future—what they hope to achieve if they successfully fulfill their organizational purpose or mission. A vision statement may describe a school’s loftiest ideals, its core organizational values, its long-term objectives, or what it hopes its students will learn or be capable of doing after graduating.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Positive thinking can make it easier for you to focus on tasks that need to be done and learn new information. For instance, if you approach learning better writing skills with a positive mindset, you may be more likely to stay focused since you're open to the experience.</p>

                <p>Masks are a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives.

                    Wearing well-fitted masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including maintaining physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, ensuring good ventilation of indoor spaces, cleaning hands regularly, and covering sneezes and coughs with a tissue of bent elbow.
                    
                    Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission, or both.</p>
